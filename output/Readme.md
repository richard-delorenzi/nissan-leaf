epa vs nedc vs wltp

# [from jdpower](https://www.jdpower.com/cars/shopping-guides/electric-vehicle-range-testing-understanding-nedc-vs-wltp-vs-epa)

- The NEDC and WLTP focus primarily on urban and suburban travel.
- EPA emphasizes highway driving
- NEDC uses ideal conditions
- WLTP over estimates real×10%
- NEDC over estimates real×25%→30%
- EPA More rigourous. More accurate (for American driving).

# [from carco](https://www.licarco.com/news/ev-range-tests-explained-comparison-between-epa-ratings-wltp-nedc-and-cltc)

- EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) ratings
- WLTP (Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure)
- NEDC (New European Driving Cycle)
- CLTC (China Light Duty Vehicle Test Cycle)
- CLTC over estimates
- WLTP records about 20% higher EV range than the NEDC
